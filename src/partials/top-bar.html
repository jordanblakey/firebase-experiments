      Scorched is an open source note taking application focused on privacy.
      Major note taking apps like Evernote and Keep store your notes in the cloud and make exporting easy.
      They are fantastic tools. Scorched is not meant to compete with, or replace them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I created Scorched to explore decoupling notes from the cloud.
      All data in Scorched exists only on your device, though feels like a cloud app.
      When you clear your cache, or delete the app, it's all gone.
      If you want to make a local copy, you can--as a password-protected, encrypted image.
      Incidentally, this is fantastic for safely storing network configurations, security questions, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notes feel very private, to me--like an extension of the brain.
      Full of half formed ideas and working assumptions.
      Not meant to be evaluated by anyone else. Ever.
      I believe it's very important for humans to have this kind of breathing room.

      Thanks for checking out Scorched.<br>
      Hope you find it interesting.<br>
      Maybe even useful.
