      Scorched is an open source note taking application focused on privacy.
      Major note taking apps like Evernote and Keep store your notes in the cloud and make exporting easy.
      They are fantastic tools. Scorched is not meant to compete with, or replace them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scorched started as an exploration in decoupling notes from the cloud.
      All data exists only on your device, though it feels like a cloud app.
      When you clear your cache, or delete the app, it's all gone.
      If you want to make a local copy, you can&mdash;as a password-protected, encrypted image.
      Incidentally, this is fantastic for safely storing network configurations & security questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notes are private&mdash;like an extension of the brain.
      Full of half formed ideas and working assumptions.
      Not meant to be evaluated by anyone else. Ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for checking out Scorched.<br>
      Hope you find it useful.<br>
